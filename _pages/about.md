Hi, I am Kishwar Ahmed. I am an Assistant Professor at [Department of Computer Science](https://www.uscb.edu/academics/academic_departments/school-of-science-and-mathematics/computer-science/) at [University of South Carolina Beaufort](https://www.uscb.edu/). I received my Ph.D. in Computer Science from the
School of Computing and Information
Sciences at [Florida International University (FIU)](https://www.fiu.edu/) under the supervision of [Prof.
Jason Liu](https://people.cis.fiu.edu/liux/) in 2018.  I received my
Master's in Computer Science from FIU in 2017 and my Bachelor's in
Computer Science and Engineering from the Department of Computer
Sciences and Engineering at [Bangladesh
University of Engineering and Technology (BUET)](http://buet.ac.bd) in 2009. I was a Research Aide at [Argonne National Laboratory](https://www.anl.gov/) during Summer 2017. 

My research interests are broadly in the areas of **high-performance
computing (HPC) systems** and **cyber-physical systems**. More specifically, my research interests include modeling and simulation, parallel computing, interconnection network, and energy-efficiency. I am particularly focusing on the accurate, scalable, and efficient modeling and simulation of HPC systems.
