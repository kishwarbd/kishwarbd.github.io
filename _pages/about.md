I am Kishwar Ahmed. I received my Ph.D. in Computer Science from the
[School of Computing and Infromation
Sciences](https://www.cis.fiu.edu) at [Florida International
University (FIU)](https://www.fiu.edu) under the supervision of [Prof.
Jason Liu](https://people.cis.fiu.edu/liux/) in 2018.  I received my
Master's in Computer Science from FIU in 2017 and my Bachelor's in
Computer Science and Engineering from the [Department of Computer
Sciene and Engineering](http://cse.buet.ac.bd) at [Bangladesh
University of Engineering and Technology (BUET)](http://buet.ac.bd).

My research interests are broadly in the areas of high-performance
computing (HPC) systems, cyber-physical systems, and quantum computing
systems. I am particularly focusing on the accurate and
energy-efficient modeling and simulation of the HPC systems.
