Hi, I am Kishwar Ahmed. I am an Assistant Professor in the [Department of Computer Science](https://www.uscb.edu/academics/academic_departments/school-of-science-and-mathematics/computer-science/) at [University of South Carolina Beaufort](https://www.uscb.edu/). I received my Ph.D. in Computer Science from the
School of Computing and Information
Sciences at [Florida International University (FIU)](https://www.fiu.edu/) under the supervision of [Prof.
Jason Liu](https://people.cis.fiu.edu/liux/) in 2018. 

My research interests are broadly in the areas of high-performance
computing (HPC) systems and cyber-physical systems. More specifically, my research interests include modeling and simulation, parallel computing, interconnection network, and energy-efficiency. I am particularly focusing on the accurate, scalable, and efficient modeling and simulation of HPC systems.
