Hi, I am Kishwar Ahmed. I am an Assistant Professor in the [Department of Computer Science](https://www.uscb.edu/academics/academic_departments/school-of-science-and-mathematics/computer-science/) at [University of South Carolina Beaufort](https://www.uscb.edu/). My research interests include high-performance computing (HPC) and cyber-physical systems. I am especially interested in the energy-efficiency and security issues of HPC systems.

I received my Ph.D. in Computer Science from Florida International University, Miami, FL. I worked with [Prof.
Jason Liu](https://people.cis.fiu.edu/liux/) for my dissertation. I also worked as a research aide at Argonne National Laboratory. I received my B.Sc. degree in Computer Science and Engineering from Bangladesh University and Technology, Dhaka, Bangladesh. I am honored to receive the NSF CRII award and the UofSC ASPIRE award.
