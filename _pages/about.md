Hi, I am Kishwar Ahmed. I received my Ph.D. in Computer Science from the
[School of Computing and Information
Sciences](https://www.cis.fiu.edu) at [Florida International University](https://www.fiu.edu/) under the supervision of [Prof.
Jason Liu](https://people.cis.fiu.edu/liux/) in 2018.  I received my
Master's in Computer Science from FIU in 2017 and my Bachelor's in
Computer Science and Engineering from the [Department of Computer
Sciences and Engineering](http://cse.buet.ac.bd) at [Bangladesh
University of Engineering and Technology (BUET)](http://buet.ac.bd) in 2009. I was a Research Aide at [Argonne National Laboratory](https://www.anl.gov/) during Summer 2017. 

My research interests are broadly in the areas of **high-performance
computing (HPC) systems**, **cyber-physical systems**, and **quantum computing
systems**. More specifically, my research interests include modeling and simulation, parallel computing, interconnection network, and energy-efficiency. I am particularly focusing on the accurate, scalable, and efficient modeling and simulation of the HPC and quantum computing systems.
